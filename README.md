# BA830-Causal-Experiment

### Project Objective
The objective of this experiment is to study the effect of different transcriptions methods on memory. We hypothesized that copy-pasting would result in even less semantic processing than typing, and that participants who copy and paste information are less likely than participants who type information to remember what they have learned. 

### Data Collection
We set up an experiment to test whether an individual is able to retain information when presented with a block of text. In the experiment, each participant is randomly assigned to one of the two groups:

* “Copy & Paste” (C&P) group, where the participants can copy and paste the answer to the questions based on the block of text that they need to read
* “Typing” (T) group, where the text is presented as a picture so the only viable option that the participants have is to type in the information that is asked of them

Having completed the reading and transcribing activities, all participants were shown the same multiple choice comprehension where they were asked questions specific to the information they had transcribed earlier. Their responses were recorded for analysis.
